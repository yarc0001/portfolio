second repository created as the first one crashed.

Hi, I am Mateo, an Interactive Media Design Student. This project was a very challenging since the very begining. First the design of the prototypes was conducted at the same time of the web site code construction which required a very thorough selection of features and a good understaing of the funcionalities learned. Second, while working on the project, the GitHub repository collapsed -my bad- and I had to start all over again. Fortunatelly, I saved the file in two locations and most of the code was saved. There must a much eaiser method to solve this kind of issues, and I will avoid messing around GitHub to ensure I don't ruin the work done.
