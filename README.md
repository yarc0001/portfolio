second repository created as the first one crashed.

Hi, I am Mateo, an Interactive Media Design Student. This project has been very challenging since the very beginning. First, the design of the prototypes was conducted at the same time of the web site code construction, which required a very thorough selection of features and a good understanding of the functionalities learned. Second, while working on the project, the GitHub repository collapsed—my bad—and I had to start all over again. Fortunately, I saved the file in two locations, and most of the code was saved. There must be a much easier method to solve this kind of issue, and I will avoid messing around on GitHub to ensure I don't ruin the work done.
